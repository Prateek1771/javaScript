# Javascript and Classes

## OOP - Object Oriented Programming

## Object
 - Collection of properties and methods.
 - toLowerCase, toUpperCase

## Why use OOP
 -  the code used to get messup, where some chunk of the code was not reusable.

## Parts of OOP
Object literal

 - Constructor function
 - Prototypes
 - Classes
 - Instance (new, this)

## 4 Pillars
 - Abstraction
    Abstraction is about hiding complex implementation details and showing only the necessary features of an object. In JavaScript, abstraction can be achieved using classes by exposing only the necessary methods and properties.

 - Encapsulation
    Encapsulation is the concept of bundling data (variables) and methods (functions) that operate on the data into a single unit (class). It also involves restricting direct access to some of the object's components, which is done using private fields.

 - Inheritance
    Inheritance allows one class to inherit properties and methods from another class. This promotes code reusability.

 - Polymorphism
    Polymorphism means "many forms," and it allows a method to do different things based on the object that it is acting upon. This can be achieved through method overriding, where a child class defines its own version of a method inherited from a parent class.
